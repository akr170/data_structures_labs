DESIGN WRITE-UP
This project need to contain two different ADTs, one for maintaining the website data,
and another one (a hash table) for storing the website object.



The Website ADT:
This is an ADT we would need to construct to store the website information. This ADT
should contain encapsulated variable to store the following information:
  - website topic
  - website address
  - website summary
  - website review
  - website rating

Since all the above listed attributes are going to be encapsulated, we are going
to need a member function to set and another member function to retrieve each
attribute.  Along with setting and retreiving each attribute, we are also going
to need overloaded operators "equals" and a friend function from ostream that will
create overloaded operator "<<".  This overloaded operator from ostream friend
function will be used to output data.  So in total, in the Website ADT, we are
going to need 14 member functions and then another three member functions that
will serve as constructor, destructor, and assignment.


The Table ADT:
This will be implemented with the help of an array and a linked list and should contain
encapsulated varible that needs to be a struct that will store each node of a
linked list that will be used to maintain a table chain. This ADT will work in conjunction
with storing the head pointers of chains in an array.

There are going to following public functions:
 *  Constructor (Queue()): A member function to initialize the object
 *  Destructor (~Queue()): A member function to free up memory when the object
                           is no longer needed 
 *  Adding a website to the table:
        This function will be used to add information to the table by adding a
        website to one of the chains
    
 *  Retriving website information from the table based on a topic
 *  Deleting all websites with a rating of 1 star
 *  Updating website reveiw and rating based on user provided topic and web address
 *  Displaying all websites on a user provided topic
 *  Display all websites stored in the table
 *  Displaying the performance information of a table by displaying the chain length at each element

Which function/functions are recursive?
The destroy chain function is going to be the recursive function
