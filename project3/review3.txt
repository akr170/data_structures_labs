EFFICIENCY WRITEUP

Q: How well did the data structure selected perform for the assigned application?
Would a different data structure work better? If so, which one and why...?

The data structures I have used in the program are quite efficient ways to manage both
the queue and the stack.



Q: What was efficient about your design and use of data structure?

1. Using a linked list as a way to manage a chain is very efficient because then
   we do not have the worry about growing or shrinking the size of the chain.
   All that is done quite efficiently by design.

2. In the program whenever the user enters a data for a website for which the
   review and rating need to be edited, the program first finds whether any website
   exists in the table that matches user information or not and then displays that
   information to the user before asking for the next input.  I think this is a
   good human interface design.



Q: What was not efficient?

The inefficient part is that although the ratings are only supposed to start at 1
and go up to 5, there is no check to validate user input for rating.



Q: What would you do differently if you had more time to solve the problem?

I would have implemented methods and functions to handle bad user input and
validate the user inputs before storing new input into the table.  I would
have also spent time throwing more meaningful error messages to the user in case
of bad input.
