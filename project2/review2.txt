EFFICIENCY WRITEUP

Q: How well did the data structure selected perform for the assigned application?
Would a different data structure work better? If so, which one and why...?

The data structure that I had thought about implementing earlier worked pretty well.
In my opinion the data structures I have used in the program is quite efficient
way to manage both queue and stack.



Q: What was efficient about your design and use of data structure?

1. Using a linked list as a way to manage queue is very efficient because then
   we do not have the worry about growing or shrinking the size of the queue.
   All that is done quite efficiently by design.

2. Using two separate ADT one to store customer group data for queue and another
   one to store customer info data on to the stack, worked quite well as well.
   This way of using two separate ADTs to store data for queue and stack is quite
   efficient as well since we are only using the memory that we actually need.



Q: What was not efficient?

The inefficient part is that there is a lot of memory usage for storing a single
data point as we have to store the pointer to the next data point to maintain the
queue.  Also it is difficult to access data randomly as the data in the linked
list does not occupy an array in the memory.



Q: What would you do differently if you had more time to solve the problem?

I would have implemented methods and functions to handle bad user input.  I would
have also spent time throwing more meaningful error messages to the user in case
of bad input.
