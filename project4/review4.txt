EFFICIENCY WRITEUP

Q: How well did the data structure selected perform for the assigned application?
Would a different data structure work better? If so, which one and why...?

The data structures I have used in the program are quite efficient ways to website data.



Q: What was efficient about your design and use of data structure?

Using a binary search tree as a way to store data is very efficient because then
we do not have the worry about growing or shrinking the size of the data as a whole.
All that is done quite efficiently by design.



Q: What was not efficient?

The inefficient part is that the test data that is being used in my program is resulting
in the creation of a binary tree that is no super efficient.  I have found that the ideal
height of the tree is quite far from the real height of the tree based on my test data.
This is because the tree is not very good at storing information when the data
contain quite similar entries. This results in an inefficient design as the search
tree at some nodes are nothing but linked lists.

This inefficieny of not having a balanced tree can be rectified by using another type of
ADT tree that enables a more balanced data storage.



Q: What would you do differently if you had more time to solve the problem?

I would have implemented methods and functions to handle bad user input and
validate the user inputs before storing new input into the table.  I would
have also spent time throwing more meaningful error messages to the user in case
of bad input.

It seems that the intent of this project is to store information such that there
are unique keywords describing each website.  Currently there is no check to ensure
that the data entered by the user with a particular keyword already exists in the
binary tree.  If I had more time, I would have implemented this check.
