DESIGN WRITE-UP
This project need to contain two different ADTs, one for maintaining the website data,
and another one (a binary search tree) for storing the website object.



The Website ADT:
This is an ADT we would need to construct to store the website information. This ADT
should contain encapsulated variable to store the following information:
  - website topic
  - website keyword
  - website address
  - website summary
  - website review
  - website rating

Since all the above listed attributes are going to be encapsulated, we are going
to need a member function to set and another member function to retrieve each
attribute.  Along with setting and retreiving each attribute, we are also going
to need overloaded operators "equals" and a friend function from ostream that will
create overloaded operator "<<".  This overloaded operator from ostream friend
function will be used to output data.  So in total, in the Website ADT, we are
going to need 14 member functions and then another three member functions that
will serve as constructor, destructor, and assignment.


The BinarySearchTree ADT:
This should contain encapsulated varible that needs to be a struct that will store
each node of a binary search tree. This ADT will work in conjunction with the 
website ADT for storing the head pointers of the data objects.

There are going to following public functions:
 *  Constructor (Queue()): A member function to initialize the object
 *  Destructor (~Queue()): A member function to free up memory when the object
                           is no longer needed 
 *  Adding a website to the table:
        This function will be used to add information to the table by adding a
        website to one of the chains
    
 *  Retriving website information from the table based on a topic
 *  Removing all websites that have a particular topic name
 *  Removing a website that has a particular keyword (The key consideration here is
    that when the websites are removed using a keyword as opposed to using a topic name
    then only one data node from the Binary Search Tree is removed)
 *  Displaying all websites stored in the Binary Search Tree
 *  Displaying the performance information of a tree by displaying # of nodes, height, and ideal height

Which function/functions are recursive?
All functions within the Binary Search Tree ADT are recursive
